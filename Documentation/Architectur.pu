note right of [OperatorHMI]
Fabrik3D Lite is designed for:
- Engineering students
- Educators in automation & robotics
- Industrial engineers seeking a first-level digital twin

It provides a simplified yet realistic simulation
that can later be extended to professional environments
with advanced kinematics and toolpath logic.
